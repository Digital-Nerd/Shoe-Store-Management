# Shoe-Store-Management
Windows Application for shoe store management
Windows Application for shoe store management is a C# .NET framework project. This application offers 3 modes: Admin, User and Guest. You can add, delete, or update the shoe catalogue as an admin. A user is a registered person. He can view and buy the shoes of his choice. His selections will be saved in his cart section, where he can view and make any further changes as per his requirements. Guest Mode is similar to user mode; in this mode, the user can only view products and not store them in a cart.

Important NOTE: Oracle 11g is used for database. Make Sure to create tables and views using the same name and attributes.
