# Shoe-Store-Management
Windows Application for shoe store management
It is a C# .NET framework project.
This application offers 3 modes: Admin, User and Guest.
As an admin you can add, delete or update the shoe catalog.
A user is a registered person. He can view and buy the shoes of his choice. His selections will be saved in his cart section, where he can view and make any further changes as per his requirements.
Guest Mode is similar to user mode only in this mode the user can only view products and not store them in cart.
